# Employee Burnout Predictor
This project has a website that predicts the Employee Burnout Rate using Machine Learning. To do so, employees/users will be given a set of 
questions, consisting of age, gender, date of joining, designation, company type, mental 
fatigue score, etc. serving as the input for the model. Based on these inputs, the 
model will calculate the Burnout Rate of the employee and then provide simple suggestive measures.
